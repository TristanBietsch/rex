# rex

**Runtime Executive for Agents** — a terminal kanban for AI coding-agent
sessions. Spawn many agents in parallel across Claude Code, Codex, Gemini,
Ollama, and anything else with a CLI; rex shows what each one is doing,
which need your input, and lets you jump into any of them like opening a tab.

Two binaries: `rex` is the Bubble Tea TUI, `rex-daemon` is the PTY supervisor.
They speak newline-delimited JSON over a Unix domain socket. The daemon
auto-starts the first time you run `rex` — you should never need to start
it by hand.

Pure Go, no cgo.

## Install

Pick whichever is easiest.

**One-liner from a checkout** — builds and drops binaries in `~/.local/bin`:

```sh
./install.sh
```

`install.sh --verbose` streams the build output; otherwise it spins quietly.
Add PATH and shell completions in one shot:

```sh
./install.sh --shell-init >> ~/.zshrc
```

**Makefile** — same thing, configurable prefix:

```sh
make install                       # ~/.local/bin
make install PREFIX=/usr/local     # /usr/local/bin (may need sudo)
```

**`go install`** — if you don't want to clone:

```sh
go install github.com/tristanbietsch/rex/cmd/rex@latest
go install github.com/tristanbietsch/rex/cmd/rex-daemon@latest
```

All three install both binaries. Make sure the install directory is on your
`PATH`:

```sh
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"   # if you used the defaults
```

First time? run `rex setup` — it wires your config and launches the TUI.

To remove:

```sh
rex uninstall --wipe-state   # or: make uninstall
```

## Quickstart

```sh
rex                                 # launch the TUI
rex status                          # "2 awaiting · 4 working · 1 completed"
rex ls                              # session table (--json for JSONL)
rex new "fix flaky billing test" --tool claude --model sonnet
rex attach 7d4f                     # full-screen PTY (ctrl+a d detaches)
rex reply 7d4f "ship it"            # answer a needs-input session
rex log -f 9e51                     # tail a session's transcript
rex wait payment-migration --until done --timeout 10m
rex digest                          # today's sessions, time, totals
rex stats                           # lifetime usage by model/tool
rex fleet ls                        # list fleets (named session groups)
rex new "load test" --fleet=launch
```

Selectors accept the **short id** (`7d4f` — first four chars of the UUID),
the **slug** (`dark-mode`), or the full UUID. The CLI is a peer of the TUI,
not an afterthought: every TUI action has a non-interactive equivalent,
output is pipe-friendly, and exit codes are meaningful (`2` = not found,
`3` = ambiguous, `7` = `rex wait` timed out, etc.).

## Management

```sh
rex doctor                          # diagnostic check (PATH, daemon, keys, config)
rex setup                           # guided first-run wizard
rex update                          # upgrade in place
rex uninstall --wipe-state          # remove rex + data
```

## Scripting

Place a Lua file at `~/.config/rex/init.lua` to hook into rex events:

```lua
-- ~/.config/rex/init.lua
rex.on("session_added", function(s)
  -- automatically prompt each new session
  rex.send(s.id, "read AGENTS.md before starting\n")
end)

rex.on("session_needs_input", function(s)
  rex.log("waiting on: " .. s.slug)
end)
```

`rex reload` re-reads `init.lua` without restarting the daemon.

## TUI

Three sections, one focus, vim keybinds, mouse where you'd expect it.

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `j` `k` `↓` `↑` | Move row selection |
| `1` `2` `3` | Jump to Needs input / Working / Completed |
| `enter` | Open the modal on the selected session |
| `space` | Peek the last turn (or inline reply if `needs_input`) |
| `n` | New-agent wizard |
| `t` | Cycle tool filter chip |
| `r` / `a` / `dd` | Rename / archive / delete |
| `i` | Focus the bottom `λ` prompt |
| `:` | Command mode (`:new`, `:attach <sel>`, `:reply <sel> …`, `:bg`, `:q`, …) |
| `S` | Settings page |
| `?` | Help overlay |

`:bg` detaches the TUI but leaves the daemon and every session running.
The next `rex` invocation restores your selection, filter, and scroll.

## CLI

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `rex` | Launch the TUI |
| `rex status` | One-line aggregate (exit `1` when something needs input) |
| `rex ls [--state …] [--tool …] [--json]` | List sessions |
| `rex new [prompt] [--tool] [--model] [--fleet]` | Spawn a session |
| `rex attach <sel> [--read-only]` | Full-screen PTY attach |
| `rex reply <sel> [text]` | Reply to a needs-input session |
| `rex send <sel>` | Pipe raw stdin to a session's PTY |
| `rex log <sel> [-n N] [-f] [--bytes]` | Print or tail the transcript |
| `rex wait <sel> [--until] [--timeout]` | Block until state changes |
| `rex rename <sel> <slug>` | Rename a session |
| `rex archive <sel>` | Hide a completed session |
| `rex rm <sel>` | Delete a session |
| `rex digest` | Daily summary: sessions, time spent, totals |
| `rex stats` | Lifetime usage by model and tool |
| `rex fleet {ls,set,unset,show}` | Manage named session groups |
| `rex reload` | Re-read `tools.yaml`, `config.yaml`, `init.lua` (SIGHUP) |
| `rex setup` | Guided first-run wizard |
| `rex doctor` | Diagnostic check |
| `rex update` | Upgrade in place |
| `rex uninstall [--wipe-state]` | Remove rex and optionally all data |
| `rex config {get,set,list,reset,edit}` | Manage settings |
| `rex daemon {start,stop,restart,status,logs}` | Manage the supervisor directly |
| `rex completion {bash,zsh,fish}` | Generate shell completions |

`rex --help` prints the full menu.

## Where things live

```
~/.local/share/rex/sessions/<id>/   meta.json + transcript.log (per session)
~/.local/state/rex/                 daemon.log, tui-state.json (saved by :bg)
~/.config/rex/                      tools.yaml, config.yaml, init.lua
$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/rex.sock           IPC (Unix domain socket, JSONL)
```

Adding a new model is a one-entry edit to `~/.config/rex/tools.yaml`, which
merges over the built-in registry — no rebuild required. See
[`docs/registry.md`](docs/registry.md).

## How it works

```
┌────────────────────┐   UDS, JSONL    ┌──────────────────────────────┐
│  rex (TUI client)  │ ◀────────────▶ │  rex-daemon (PTY supervisor) │
│  stateless render  │                  │  state store + adapters      │
└────────────────────┘                  └──────────────┬───────────────┘
                                                        │ creack/pty
                                                        ▼
                                          claude · codex · gemini · ollama · …
```

The daemon owns the child processes and persists each session's metadata and
rolling transcript on disk; the TUI is a stateless renderer over a snapshot +
diff stream. Quit the TUI with `q` and your sessions keep running — reattach
any time with `rex`. The socket and JSONL protocol are deliberately
debuggable with `socat`, `jq`, and `tail`.
